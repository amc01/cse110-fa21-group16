## Context and Problem Statement

We were unsure about whether or not to keep the side navigation bar in our landing page.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Side navigation bar can give users more ways to navigate

## Considered Options

* Keep side navigation bar as it is right now
* Remove it completely and put a link in each section's title instead

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Remove it completely and put a link in each section's title instead, because we felt like it is kind of redundant to have a side navigation bar since every section will be displayed on the landing page

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* The landing page will look more clean and less clunky
* Faster development process since we don't have to code up a navbar

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Users may find it inconvenient to not have a navbar

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Keep side navigation bar as it is right now

* Good, because users may or may not find it convenient
* Bad, because it looks out of place with our current design
* Bad, repetitive in terms of navigation choices

### Remove it completely and put a link in each section's title instead

* Good, because we don't have to worry about designing a navbar
* Good, because landing page will look cleaner
* Bad, because may limit navigation choices
