## Discussion

- Users (user stories): 
  - should think about 5-8 different kinds of user
  - take into account all kinds of users
  - don't try to filter out any users or features yet
  - put every single idea out there
  - breadth-wise brainstorming
  - cut down ideas LATER
  - don't think about implementation now
  - suggestion from members:
    - Daniel: parents cook for family
      - portion size is different from a student
      - family size / portion
    - Andrew: people who are into fitness
      - they will look into nutrition info. of the recipe
      - eat smaller meals throughout the day instead of 3 meals/day
- Situation:
  - dinner vs holidays?
  - suggestion from members:
    - Gavin: time and ingredients of food
- Upload feature:
  - suggestion from members:
    - Daniel: take picture of food and convert picture into text (for ingredients)
- Homepage:
  - recipes preloaded upon landing
  - acquire recipes and store them in a database, and then load them into homepage
  - steps:
    - use API to scrape data
    - store scraped data into database
    - load data from database into homepage

- Filtering features:
  - suggestion from members (forgot to keep track of authors lol):
    - calories intake
    - time to cook
    - dietary restriction
    - price
    - ethnic food
    - categories of food
- CREATE function to store data into database
- READ function to load data
- UPDATE function:
  - why do we want to have this?
  - suggestion from members:
    - Daniel: more involvement from users
    - Andrew: users might want changes/fixes to recipes

- User update recipes they didn't upload:
  - suggestion from members:
    - Daniel: clone/fork the recipe and change it

- "Favorite" feature:
  - suggestion from members:
    - Edwin: similar to Uber-Eats feature
- Add. performance:
  - shouldn't we make it fancier to make it more appealing?
  - suggestion from members:
    - Daniel: make it fancy but avoid popups
    - Mohammed: try to use images with faster load time
    - Tai: styling but not too much

- Domain-specific feature:
  - timer
  - suggestion from members:
    - Daniel: 
      - built-in unit conversion (cups to tablespoons) GOOD ONE
      - ability access purchase links to ingredients
      - auto-scroll to help users avoid touching screen while cooking

    - Tai:
      - text-to-speech instructions
    - Gavin: 
      - language changes
  - ability to rate recipes
  - ability to share recipes with friends/family
- We should check out features from other web applications
- Water down the goods, bads, and commons from those apps.
- Our app. should NOT only contain the "commons" (death by similarity)
- We need to find the right balance between unique and common features
- Roles:
  - designers
  - developers:
    - front-end
    - back-end
    - database
  - testers
    - manual
    - automatic
  - github repo. handlers:
    - handle code review, merge, branch, pull-request
    - feature branches (industry practice):
      - each feature should have their own branch
        - everyone who are working on this feature should make their own branch and make changes only to that branch
        - lookout for blocker! (1 feature might depend on the other)
          - carefully and manually review and merge
  - planners:
    - help set up meetings, documentation, etc.
    - keep track of the development of project


## Tasks / ToDo
- New roles assignment: 
  - Github repo. handlers
  - Planners
- Start diagramming ideas into Miro

## For next meeting
