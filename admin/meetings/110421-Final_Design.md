## Discussion
- Looked at the first version of the final design of the app.
- We will no longer include the side bar because our landing page will have most of the functionalities of a side bar implement in it
- Changed the design for the add recipe page (each ingredient will have its own section with the amount and the units). This will allow us to make changes in a faster and more efficient manner.
- Discussed how we are going to implement the favorite function and considering keeping track of the ingredients a current user has (cook book)
- Placeholders for backgrounds and styling for now
- Multiple filters: For right now we will do one filter at a time and progressively change it to multiple filters at a time
- Landing Page: Cards that are do not belong to that filter should be hidden (The filter would be applied to all three sections in the landing page)
- Filtering: For now we will just filter by dietary restrictions
- Filter ideas: filter by cuisine, time and cost
- Single page app or not?
  - Our app will most likely have both (multiple pages with SPA functionality)
- Make the CRUD features in a separate page. If we're viewing a recipe, then we want to make it a single page
- Do we want the button to lead to another page or to pop up?
- Divide the roles for the devs. Split them into teams to complete front end first
- Pair Programming? Yes
- Don't push code to the main branch. For each component create a separate branch and request a review

Roles:

- Kangmin, Edwin, Gavin : Landing, view recipe, favorite page, my recipe page and feature page 

- Evan: Style guide

- Evan, Andy and Tai: The other 4 pages


## Tasks / ToDo
- Finish all Front-End pages by Wednesday (aim for earlier)
- Finish Front-End and Back-End by next meeting (Sunday)
- Explore the spoonacular API since it provides good functionality to manage recipes 

## For next meeting
- Front-End and Back-End finished!!

### Meeting finished at: 2:01 PM
