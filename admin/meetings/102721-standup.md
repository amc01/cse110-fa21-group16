## Today's agenda
- discuss important things to do this week

## Announcement
- Project pitch due: Monday Nov. 1st !!!

## Discussion
- miro board needs more organization
  - put user personas and stories in a better format
- for this week:
  - filter out research
  - **specify users and features**
    - choose a subset of users
    - add constraints (we have limited time/resources)
    - what do you want your app. to focus on?
      - nutrition
      - homemade recipes
      - etc.    
  - **after specifying the users, we will pick out the features for our app**.
    - add some spice/unique features to app.
        - don't make it too simple
    - CRUD features required
    - bare minimum:
      - create/read/upload/delete
    - after the bare minimum, think about the domain-specific and unique features
  - **evaluate risks** with respect to these features
    - which features would lead to some level of risk and why?
    - example: speech-to-text
      - you use 3rd party API which leads to less control over the feature
        - if the API is down then you can't do anything
  - **project timeline**
    - planning meeting
      - discuss important points and features
      - discuss resources that will be used
    - week 5:

    - design team will design the UI for the app. and present it to the team
    - show them on miro
    - should be done by tomorrow (or friday)?
    - event modeling diagram:
      - how does the user navigate back and forth between screens
      - visualize every action and transition of the app.
  - combine everything into some kind of document to create a project pitch
  - skim (or read) the book *Shape It Up* about writing a pitch
  - for our project pitch:
